# Fixed fields and fixing subgroups

Complements to Mathlib's Galois correspondence: its interaction with the complete-lattice
operations, when a fixed field and an intermediate field generate the whole extension, when the
correspondence survives dropping finiteness of `M / K` for a finite subgroup, and what the
correspondence gives for a cyclic subgroup.

Taking fixed fields always sends joins of automorphism subgroups to intersections of intermediate
fields. For two finite subgroups it also sends their intersection to the compositum of their
fixed fields, with no hypothesis on the ambient extension. The indexed intersection law is stated
for finite Galois extensions, including the empty family. Both binary and indexed forms are recorded
so that finite generating families and arbitrary families can use these lattice laws without
manually passing through the order dual in the Galois correspondence.

For a finite subgroup `H ≤ Gal(M/K)` and an intermediate field `E`, the fixed field of `H` and
`E` generate `M` exactly when `H` meets the fixers of `E` trivially.
With no hypothesis on `M / K`, the fixers of an arbitrary join of intermediate fields are the
automorphisms fixing each of them.

The correspondence is equivariant for conjugation: the fixed field of a conjugate subgroup is the
image of the fixed field under the conjugating automorphism.

The correspondence between subgroups and their fixed fields also holds with no hypothesis on
`M / K` at all, provided the subgroup is finite: Artin's theorem makes `M` finite Galois over the
fixed field of a finite `H`, and the fixers of that field are then exactly `H`. This is how a
subgroup of the automorphism group of an infinite extension is recovered from the field it cuts
out; the fixing subgroup of a subfield of finite degree is finite for the same reason.

The last results specialise the correspondence to a *cyclic* subgroup: the field fixed by a finite
cyclic group of automorphisms has `M` cyclic over it, and for `⟨σ⟩` there is a named automorphism
over the fixed field — `AlgEquiv.toFixedFieldAlgEquiv σ` acts on `M` as `σ` does, and generates
once `⟨σ⟩` is finite.

Neither `M / K` Galois nor `M / K` finite is needed, and neither is faithfulness of the action:
`FixedPoints.toAlgAut_surjective` asks only that the group be finite, and cyclicity passes along
its surjection. The fixed-point subfield it produces is the one underlying
`IntermediateField.fixedField`.

A simple extension `K⟮x⟯` is fixed pointwise by exactly those automorphisms that fix `x`, so
its fixing subgroup is the stabilizer of `x`; this too needs no hypothesis on `M / K` at all.

Two facts hold for every intermediate field `E` algebraic over `K`, with no separability anywhere
and nothing asked of `M / K`: its fixing subgroup is closed in the Krull topology, being the
intersection over the finite simple subextensions of their open fixing subgroups; and it is
unchanged by cutting `E` down to its part inside `separableClosure K M`, because every element of
`E` has a `q`-th power iterate there. The second is why a Galois correspondence over an
inseparable extension can only be indexed by the intermediate fields of the separable closure.

* `IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup_inf_separableClosure`
* `IntermediateField.fixedField_fixingSubgroup`: the correspondence over an intermediate field
  with Galois extension above it, without a Galois assumption on the original base
* `IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup_fixedField_of_finite`

  dividing the degree, since that order is the degree over the field fixed by all automorphisms

characteristic of `K`.

No faithfulness is asked of the action: `FixedPoints.toAlgAut_surjective` needs only finiteness,
and cyclicity passes along any surjection. A non-faithful action simply presents the Galois group
as a proper quotient of `G`, which is cyclic all the same. -/

/-- **The automorphism of `M` over `M ^ ⟨σ⟩` given by `σ`.** Acting through `⟨σ⟩` fixes
`M ^ ⟨σ⟩` pointwise, so `σ` is an automorphism over that field; this is that automorphism, and
nothing more. It is `σ` rebundled over a smaller base, so the name says only that.

Named rather than inlined so that consumers have a term to talk about: a fibre count needs the
relative Frobenius exhibited as a specific power of a specific generator, and `IsCyclic` supplies
only an anonymous one. Use `toFixedFieldAlgEquiv_apply` to compute with it. That it *generates* is
`zpowers_toFixedFieldAlgEquiv_eq_top`, a separate statement, and it is the only one that needs
`⟨σ⟩` to be finite. -/

between their values. -/

# The Robinson--Schensted correspondence for words

Inserting the letters of a word `w = w₁ w₂ ⋯ wₙ` one after another into the empty tableau by
Schensted row insertion gives its **insertion tableau** `P(w) = (⋯((∅ ← w₁) ← w₂) ⋯) ← wₙ`.
Recording, for each `k`, the row `rₖ` in which the insertion of `wₖ` adds its new cell gives its
**recording word** `r₁ r₂ ⋯ rₙ`. The recording word is the row-by-row record of the usual
recording tableau `Q(w)`, the standard tableau with the entry `k` in the cell added at step `k`:
a standard tableau is determined by the row of each of its entries, and the words arising this
way from standard tableaux of shape `λ` are exactly the lattice words in which each letter `i`
occurs `λᵢ` times.

The **Robinson--Schensted correspondence** `TauCeti.robinsonSchenstedEquiv` says that
`w ↦ (P(w), r(w))` is a bijection from words onto the pairs of a semistandard tableau `P` and a
lattice word `r` such that row `i` of `P` has as many cells as `r` has letters `i`. Injectivity and
surjectivity both follow, one letter at a time, from the fact that a single row insertion is a
bijection onto tableaux with a chosen corner (`TauCeti.rowInsertEquiv`). For a word without
repeated letters, such as a permutation in one-line notation, the insertion tableau has distinct
entries (`TauCeti.flatten_robinsonSchensted_fst_perm`); this is the case underlying the classical
bijection between permutations and pairs of standard tableaux of the same shape.

## Main definitions

* `List.IsLatticeWord`: a lattice word, in which every prefix contains each letter `i` at least as
  often as `i + 1`.
* `TauCeti.robinsonSchensted`: the insertion tableau and the recording word of a word.
* `TauCeti.robinsonSchenstedEquiv`: the Robinson--Schensted correspondence, as a bijection.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.flatten_robinsonSchensted_fst_perm`: the insertion tableau has the letters of the word.
* `TauCeti.length_getD_robinsonSchensted_fst`: the shape of the insertion tableau is the content of
  the recording word.
* `TauCeti.isLatticeWord_robinsonSchensted_snd`: the recording word is a lattice word.
* `TauCeti.robinsonSchensted_injective` and `TauCeti.exists_robinsonSchensted_eq_iff`: the
  correspondence is injective, and its image is described by the three properties above.

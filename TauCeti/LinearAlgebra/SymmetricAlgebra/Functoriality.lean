# Functoriality of symmetric algebras

A linear map induces an algebra homomorphism between symmetric algebras. This file constructs the
map from the universal property, proves its identity and composition laws, and packages linear
equivalences as algebra equivalences. Chosen one-sided inverses remain one-sided inverses after
passing to symmetric algebras.

The construction and its lemma set follow Mathlib's `CliffordAlgebra.map` and `ExteriorAlgebra.map`
functoriality APIs (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/Basic.lean` and
`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorAlgebra/Basic.lean`); `map_surjective` adapts the corresponding
Clifford-algebra induction.

## Main definitions

* `SymmetricAlgebra.map`: the algebra homomorphism induced by a linear map.
* `SymmetricAlgebra.mapEquiv`: the algebra equivalence induced by a linear equivalence.

## Main results

* `SymmetricAlgebra.map_apply_ι`: evaluation of the induced map on a canonical generator.
* `SymmetricAlgebra.map_id` and `SymmetricAlgebra.map_comp_map`: functoriality laws.
* `SymmetricAlgebra.map_injective_of_leftInverse` and `SymmetricAlgebra.map_surjective`:
  transport of split monomorphisms and of surjections.

## Roadmap

This supplies the symmetric-algebra side of functoriality for subalgebras and direct sums in
Layer 3 of the LieHighestWeight roadmap. The product comparison and naturality of the canonical
map to the PBW associated graded are downstream.

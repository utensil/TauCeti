# The subgroup scheme of `GLₙ` preserving a constant matrix

For a commutative ring `R`, a natural number `n`, and a **constant** matrix
`C : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) R`, the entries of the matrix relation

```text
X C Xᵀ - C
```

— `X` the localized generic matrix of `GL n`, `C` read in the coordinate Hopf algebra through
the structure morphism — generate a Hopf ideal in the coordinate Hopf algebra of `GL n`. Its
quotient represents the closed subgroup scheme of `GL n` preserving `C`. On every commutative
`R`-algebra `A`, its points are the invertible matrices `M` with `M C Mᵀ = C`.

Nothing is assumed of `C`: it is an arbitrary square matrix over the base, not required to be
invertible, symmetric, alternating, or nondegenerate, and the construction includes `n = 0` and
the zero ring. The classical families are the specializations at a constant form:
`TauCeti.Orthogonal` takes `C = 1` and `TauCeti.Symplectic` takes `C = Jₘ`, each adding its own
identification of the points with the corresponding matrix group. This file supplies everything
those specializations share: the relation matrix, the Hopf ideal with its three closure
conditions, the quotient, the group scheme with its closed immersion into `GLₙ`, and the
ambient membership criterion `M C Mᵀ = C`; local finite type comes from the generic
`CommHopfAlgCat.locallyOfFiniteType_quotientSpec` instance, which applies to the
reducible `groupScheme` directly.

The three Hopf-ideal closure conditions are proved by matrix algebra rather than coordinate by
coordinate. Writing `f := X C Xᵀ - C` for the matrix of generators and mapping it entrywise
through the relevant algebra morphisms — each of which fixes `C`, being an `R`-algebra
morphism:

* the counit sends `X` to the identity matrix, so it sends `f` to `1 C 1ᵀ - C = 0`;
* the comultiplication sends `X` to `Y Z`, where `Y` and `Z` are the two tensor inclusions of
  `X`, and

  ```text
  (Y Z) C (Y Z)ᵀ - C = Y (Z C Zᵀ - C) Yᵀ + (Y C Yᵀ - C),
  ```

  whose two summands are the right and left tensor inclusions of `f` framed by matrices, so
  every entry lies in the right or left tensor ideal;
* the antipode sends `X` to its inverse matrix, and

  ```text
  X⁻¹ C (X⁻¹)ᵀ - C = -(X⁻¹ (X C Xᵀ - C) (X⁻¹)ᵀ),
  ```

  so every entry of the antipode image is a combination of the generators.

That each identity holds for an arbitrary constant `C` is what makes the classical examples
specializations rather than separate constructions: no step inverts `C`, transposes it, or uses
a relation between `C` and `Cᵀ`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ConstantForm.relationMatrix`: the matrix of defining relations `X C Xᵀ - C`.
* `TauCeti.ConstantForm.definingHopfIdeal_toIdeal_le_ker_iff`: a coordinate morphism kills the
  defining ideal exactly when its generic matrix `X` satisfies `X C Xᵀ = C`.
* `TauCeti.ConstantForm.definingHopfIdeal`: the Hopf ideal its entries generate.
* `TauCeti.ConstantForm.coordinateHopfAlgebra` and `TauCeti.ConstantForm.coordinateMap`: the
  quotient coordinate Hopf algebra and the quotient morphism onto it.
* `TauCeti.ConstantForm.groupScheme` and `TauCeti.ConstantForm.inclusion`: the subgroup scheme
  preserving `C` and its closed immersion into the general linear group scheme — the generic
  `GeneralLinear.hopfIdealInclusion` at the defining Hopf ideal — with `groupScheme_def` and
  `inclusion_def` exposing the quotient-spectrum presentations.
* `TauCeti.ConstantForm.mem_definingPointsSubgroup_iff`: an ambient point is cut out exactly
  when its matrix `M` satisfies `M C Mᵀ = C`.

  introduced as the subgroups of `GLₙ` cut out by the entries of a form relation.

The matrix form of the closure computations is standard, and the framing identities above are
not adapted from either reference. The proofs themselves are those of the merged worked
examples `TauCeti.Symplectic` (for `C = Jₘ`) and `TauCeti.Orthogonal` (for `C = 1`),
generalized here to an arbitrary `C`: the declaration order and proof plan are theirs, and
those two files now consume this one rather than repeating it. `TauCeti.Symplectic` recorded
the generalization in its own module docstring — that the computations "apply verbatim to
`X C Xᵀ - C` for any constant matrix `C`" — before it was carried out.

# Splitting fields of a central simple algebra

A field extension `L / K` **splits** a `K`-algebra `A` when the scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A` is a
full matrix algebra over `L`. This file defines that predicate, `TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField`,
gives it its basic API, and settles the two cases that need no field theory: an **algebraically
closed** extension splits every finite-dimensional central simple algebra, and over a **finite**
base field every central simple algebra is already split by the base field itself.

The name is qualified because Mathlib's root-namespace `IsSplittingField` is the unrelated
predicate that a field extension splits a *polynomial*.

## The matrix size

For a central simple `A` the size of the matrix algebra is not extra data: it is forced to be
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg K A`. Scalar extension preserves the dimension
(`Module.finrank L (L ⊗[K] A) = Module.finrank K A`) and `Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) L` has dimension
`n ^ 2` over `L`, so a splitting exhibits `Module.finrank K A` as `n ^ 2`; for a central simple `A`
that dimension is already the square of the degree
(`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_sq`), so `n = TauCeti.Algebra.deg K A`. This is
`TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_deg`, and it is why the existential in
the definition costs nothing: the definition quantifies over `n` only so that it can be stated for
an arbitrary `K`-algebra, where the degree is not yet meaningful.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField`: the predicate itself, unfolded by
  `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_iff`, with the transport
  `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_congr` along a `K`-algebra isomorphism of `A` and the
  observation `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_matrix` that a full matrix algebra over `K` is
  split by every extension (by the base change `TauCeti.Algebra.matrixBaseChangeAlgEquiv` of
  `TauCeti/Algebra/Matrix/BaseChange.lean`).
* `TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField.matrix`: a splitting field for `A` also splits every full
  matrix algebra over `A`.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_self_iff`: `A` is split by its own base field exactly when it
  *is* a matrix algebra over it. This is the statement that "split" means what it should.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.finrank_eq_sq_of_algEquiv_matrix` and
  `TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_deg`: the dimension count and, for a
  central simple `A`, the identification of the matrix size with the degree.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_of_isAlgClosed`: **an algebraically closed extension splits
  every finite-dimensional central simple algebra**.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_self_of_finite`: **over a finite field every central simple
  algebra is split by the base field**, so there is nothing to split.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField` is stated with `L ⊗[K] A`, the base field on the *left*, because
that is the orientation in which `L ⊗[K] A` carries its `L`-algebra structure by
`Algebra.TensorProduct.leftAlgebra` with no further glue, and it is the orientation of the base
change already on `main` in `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Degree.lean`.

The predicate deliberately asks for nothing of `A` beyond being a `K`-algebra: the elementary
lemmas hold at that generality, and central simplicity is added only where the degree is mentioned.
Nothing here needs `A` to be finite-dimensional either -- that is a consequence for a nonzero
splitting, not a hypothesis.

A further extension of a splitting field again splits `A`, but the algebra-level base-change
cancellation `M ⊗[L] (L ⊗[K] A) ≃ₐ[M] M ⊗[K] A` that this rests on is not available for a
noncommutative `A` (Mathlib's `Algebra.TensorProduct.cancelBaseChange` asks both tensor factors to
be commutative), so it is left to the file that builds it.

/-- An extension `L / K` **splits** the `K`-algebra `A` when the scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A` is a
full matrix algebra over `L`.

The matrix size is existentially quantified so that the predicate makes sense for an arbitrary
`K`-algebra. For a finite-dimensional central simple `A` it is not a choice: it is forced to be
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg K A` by `TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_deg`. -/
def IsSplittingField (K A L : Type*) [Field K] [Ring A] [Algebra K A] [Field L] [Algebra K L] :

variable (K : Type*) [Field K] (A : Type*) [Ring A] [Algebra K A]
  (L : Type*) [Field L] [Algebra K L]

/-- **The definition, unfolded**: `L` splits `A` exactly when `L ⊗[K] A` is an `n × n` matrix
algebra over `L` for some `n`.

This is the characterization at the generality the predicate is stated at, and everything below
goes through it rather than through the body; for a finite-dimensional central simple `A` the size
is pinned by `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_iff_deg`. -/

    IsSplittingField K A L ↔ ∃ n : ℕ, Nonempty (L ⊗[K] A ≃ₐ[L] Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) L) :=

/-- Splitting is a property of the isomorphism class of `A`: a `K`-algebra isomorphic to a split
one is split, by the same extension and with the same matrix size. -/

    IsSplittingField K A L ↔ IsSplittingField K B L :=

/-- **A full matrix algebra over `K` is split by every extension of `K`**, by
`TauCeti.Algebra.matrixBaseChangeAlgEquiv`. In particular it is split by `K` itself. -/
theorem isSplittingField_matrix (n : ℕ) : IsSplittingField K (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K) L :=
  (isSplittingField_iff K _ L).2 ⟨n, ⟨matrixBaseChangeAlgEquiv K L (Fin n)⟩⟩

/-- If `L` splits a `K`-algebra `A`, then it also splits every full matrix algebra over `A`.

After base change, the given splitting identifies each matrix entry with an `m × m` matrix over
`L`; composing the two matrix indices gives an `(n * m) × (n * m)` matrix over `L`. -/
theorem IsSplittingField.matrix (h : IsSplittingField K A L) (n : ℕ) :
    IsSplittingField K (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) A) L := by

      Matrix.compFinAlgEquiv n m L L

/-- **`A` is split by its own base field exactly when it is a matrix algebra over it.** This is the
sanity check on the definition: over `L = K` the scalar extension does nothing, so "split" is
literally "is a matrix algebra". -/
theorem isSplittingField_self_iff :
    IsSplittingField K A K ↔ ∃ n : ℕ, Nonempty (A ≃ₐ[K] Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K) :=

    ⟨fun ⟨e⟩ ↦ ⟨(Algebra.TensorProduct.lid K A).symm.trans e⟩,
      fun ⟨e⟩ ↦ ⟨(Algebra.TensorProduct.lid K A).trans e⟩⟩

/-- **`L` splits `A` exactly when `L` splits the `L`-algebra `L ⊗[K] A`.**

Both sides say `∃ n, L ⊗[K] A ≃ₐ[L] Mₙ(L)`, the left through
`TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_self_iff` and the right by definition. The lemma exists to move
between the two readings, and so to bring results about a field splitting an algebra over *itself*
to bear on a scalar extension. -/
theorem isSplittingField_baseChange_self_iff :
    IsSplittingField L (L ⊗[K] A) L ↔ IsSplittingField K A L :=
  (isSplittingField_self_iff L (L ⊗[K] A)).trans (isSplittingField_iff K A L).symm

/-- **The dimension count behind a splitting**: if `L ⊗[K] A` is `n × n` matrices over `L`, then
`A` has dimension `n ^ 2` over `K`.

Scalar extension preserves the dimension, and an `n × n` matrix algebra has dimension `n ^ 2`; no
hypothesis on `A` is used, and in particular this is what *proves* that a split algebra has square
dimension rather than assuming it. -/

/-- **The matrix size of a splitting is the degree.** For a finite-dimensional central simple `A`,
any splitting `L ⊗[K] A ≃ₐ[L] Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) L` has `n = TauCeti.Algebra.deg K A`, so the
splitting can always be restated at that size.

The existential in `TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField` is therefore not a choice: `n ^ 2` and
`(deg K A) ^ 2` are both `Module.finrank K A` (`TauCeti.Algebra.finrank_eq_sq_of_algEquiv_matrix`
and `TauCeti.Algebra.deg_sq`), and squaring is injective on the naturals. -/
theorem IsSplittingField.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_deg (h : IsSplittingField K A L) :

/-- **An algebraically closed extension splits every finite-dimensional central simple algebra.**

This is the base case of the splitting theory, and it needs no theory of maximal subfields: over an
algebraically closed field the Wedderburn division algebra collapses, which is exactly
`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_baseChange_of_isAlgClosed`. Every finite-dimensional
central simple `K`-algebra therefore has a splitting field, namely an algebraic closure of `K`. -/
theorem isSplittingField_of_isAlgClosed [IsAlgClosed L] : IsSplittingField K A L :=
  (isSplittingField_iff_deg K A L).2
    (IsSimpleRing.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_baseChange_of_isAlgClosed K L A)

/-- **Over a finite field every central simple algebra is split by the base field.** A finite
central division algebra is its own base field (little Wedderburn), so the Wedderburn presentation
of `A` is already a matrix algebra over `K`; there is nothing left for an extension to split.

Together with `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_self_iff` this is the algebra-level content of the
triviality of the Brauer group of a finite field. -/

/-- **`ℂ` splits the real quaternions.** `ℂ` is algebraically closed, so this is
`TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_of_isAlgClosed`; all three of `Algebra.IsCentral ℝ ℍ[ℝ]`,
`IsSimpleRing ℍ[ℝ]` and `FiniteDimensional ℝ ℍ[ℝ]` are found by instance search. -/
example : IsSplittingField ℝ ℍ[ℝ] ℂ := isSplittingField_of_isAlgClosed ℝ ℍ[ℝ] ℂ

/-- The splitting of `ℍ[ℝ]` by `ℂ` happens at the degree, so it is
`ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℂ] Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ` on the nose. -/

/-- **`ℝ` does not split the real quaternions**, so a central simple algebra need not be split by
its own base field and the notion is not vacuous. A splitting over `ℝ` would make `ℍ[ℝ]` a matrix
algebra over `ℝ`, necessarily of size `2` by the dimension count, and a `2 × 2` matrix algebra has
zero divisors while `ℍ[ℝ]` does not. -/

# The eight Thurston model geometries

`TauCeti.ModelGeometry` is the closed list of spherical, Euclidean, hyperbolic,
`S² × ℝ`, `ℍ² × ℝ`, `SL₂ℝ~`, Nil, and Sol geometries. Its `Space` and `model` accessors select
concrete manifolds with the standard analytic Riemannian metrics. The three-dimensional model
vector spaces, analytic manifold structures, and transitive actions of the full Riemannian
isometry groups are available uniformly for an arbitrary member of the list.

The metrics and their homogeneity proofs come from the individual model files. In particular,
the product geometries carry the product metrics, and Nil, Sol, and `SL₂ℝ~` keep their distinct
metrics on distinct type synonyms of `ℝ³`. The acting group is `TauCeti.Isom G.model G.Space`,
which contains every smooth self-diffeomorphism preserving the metric, rather than just the
transitive subgroups exhibited by those proofs.

This finite index type allows geometric-structure statements to quantify over the eight models
without allowing arbitrary homogeneous spaces. A manifold modeled on `G` can use
`ChartedSpace G.Space M` and the existing isometry-action structure groupoid; completeness of
such a structure is an additional condition on its induced metric.

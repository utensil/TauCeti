# The inverse function theorem for manifolds

Mathlib knows that a `C^n` local diffeomorphism has invertible differentials
(`IsLocalDiffeomorphAt.mfderivToContinuousLinearEquiv`) and lists the converse as a TODO in
`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/LocalDiffeomorph.lean`. This file proves that converse at interior
points of Banach manifolds: a map which is `C^n` on an open set, with `1 ≤ n`, and whose `mfderiv`
at a point of that set is a continuous linear equivalence, is a `C^n` local diffeomorphism there.

The interior-point form applies to maps between manifolds with boundary whenever the source point
lies away from the boundary; invertibility of the differential then forces its image to be an
interior point as well. On a boundaryless source manifold the source condition is automatic, even
when either ambient model has boundary, yielding the usual global criterion from invertibility of
every differential.

The file also records that maximal-atlas charts are local diffeomorphisms, and that being a local
diffeomorphism at a point is an open condition: the partial diffeomorphism witnessing it at one
point witnesses it at every nearby point.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.coe_diffeomorphOfBijective`: the associated global diffeomorphism
  has the original forward map.
* `TauCeti.extChartPartialDiffeomorph`: an extended chart restricted to the interior of its target,
  as a partial diffeomorphism onto an open subset of the model space.
* `TauCeti.PartialDiffeomorph.ofOpenPartialHomeomorph`: an open partial homeomorphism between
  model spaces which is `C^n` in both directions, as a partial diffeomorphism.
* `TauCeti.isLocalDiffeomorphAt_of_mfderiv_eq`: the inverse function theorem for manifolds.
* `TauCeti.isLocalDiffeomorphAt_iff_exists_mfderiv_eq`: the resulting characterisation of
  `IsLocalDiffeomorphAt` at an interior point, for a map which is `C^n` on an open set.
* `TauCeti.isLocalDiffeomorphAt_of_eqOn`: a map agreeing with a partial diffeomorphism on its
  source is a local diffeomorphism there.
* `OpenPartialHomeomorph.isLocalDiffeomorphAt_of_mem_maximalAtlas`: a maximal-atlas chart is a
  local diffeomorphism at every point of its source.
* `IsLocalDiffeomorphAt.eventually`: being a local diffeomorphism at a point is an open
  condition.
* `TauCeti.isLocalDiffeomorph_of_mfderiv_eq`: the global version.

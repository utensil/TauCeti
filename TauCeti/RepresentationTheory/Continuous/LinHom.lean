# The Hom representation of two continuous representations

Given continuous representations `π` on `V` and `ρ` on `W` of a group `G`, the operators
`V →L[𝕜] W` carry the conjugation action `T ↦ ρ g ∘ T ∘ π g⁻¹`. This file builds it as a
`ContRepresentation` on the operator space, the continuous counterpart of Mathlib's
`Representation.linHom` on `V →ₗ[𝕜] W`.

Two facts make the construction worth naming. Its **invariants are exactly the continuous
intertwiners**: `ρ g ∘ T ∘ π g⁻¹ = T` for every `g` says precisely that `T` intertwines, so
`Mathlib`'s `ContIntertwiningMap π ρ` is the invariant subspace of this representation. And its
**character is `χ_π(g⁻¹) · χ_ρ(g)`**, because the operator space is the finite-dimensional
`V →ₗ[𝕜] W` with the conjugation action, whose character Mathlib computes
(`Representation.char_linHom`).

Together these turn a character integral into the dimension of a space of intertwiners: over a
compact group, Haar-averaging this representation counts its invariants, which is what
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Intertwiner/Dimension.lean` does.

Restricting the two sides along the two projections of a product of groups gives the **two-sided**
Hom representation `ContRepresentation.biLinHom`: for `π` on `V` over `H` and `ρ` on `W` over `G`
it is the representation of `G × H` on `V →L[𝕜] W` on which `(g, h)` acts by
`T ↦ ρ g ∘ T ∘ π h⁻¹`. It is the same construction, restricted along the two projections, so it
needs nothing beyond what `ContRepresentation.linHom` needs. Taking `H = G`, `W = V` and `ρ = π`
specializes it to the two-sided action of `G × G` on the operators of a single representation,
which is how the Peter-Weyl block of a compact group is read.

The carrier is the operator space `V →L[𝕜] W`, not `V →ₗ[𝕜] W`: a `ContRepresentation` acts by
continuous linear maps on a topological module, and the operator norm is what makes the operators
one. In finite dimension the two carriers agree, and `ContRepresentation.conj_linHom` is
that comparison, stated as the identity that transports Mathlib's algebraic conjugation action to
this one along `LinearMap.toContinuousLinearMap`.

## Main definitions

* `ContRepresentation.linHom`: the Hom representation `T ↦ ρ g ∘ T ∘ π g⁻¹` on
  `V →L[𝕜] W`.
* `ContRepresentation.biLinHom`: its two-sided form, the representation of `G × H` on
  `V →L[𝕜] W` acting by `(g, h) • T = ρ g ∘ T ∘ π h⁻¹`.
* `ContRepresentation.invariantsEquivContIntertwiningMap`: its invariant subspace is the
  space of continuous intertwiners `π →ⁱL ρ`.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.continuous_linHom` and `ContRepresentation.continuous_biLinHom`: the Hom
  representation of two representations with continuous operator-valued action again has one, and
  likewise for the two-sided form.
* `ContRepresentation.linHom_apply_eq_self_iff_isIntertwining`: an operator is fixed by the
  conjugation action exactly when it intertwines, and
  `ContRepresentation.mem_linHom_invariants_iff_isIntertwining`: the same read on the invariant
  subspace.
* `ContRepresentation.character_linHom`: its character is `χ_π(g⁻¹) · χ_ρ(g)`.
* `ContRepresentation.isIrreducible_biLinHom`: irreducibility of the two-sided Hom action.

## References

The algebraic originals are Mathlib's: `Representation.linHom` for the conjugation action,
`Representation.mem_linHom_invariants_iff_isIntertwining` and
`Representation.invariantsEquivIntertwiningMap` for the identification of its invariants with the
intertwiners — of which `ContRepresentation.linHom_apply_eq_self_iff_isIntertwining` and
`ContRepresentation.invariantsEquivContIntertwiningMap` are the continuous analogues, the first
proved by transporting the algebraic one — and `Representation.char_linHom` for the character.

The Hom representation lets a character integral count intertwiners, the compact-group form of
Mathlib's finite-group `Representation.card_inv_mul_sum_char_mul_char_eq_finrank`. The mathematical
development follows Daniel Bump, *Lie Groups*, second edition, Chapter 2.

intertwining equation `T ∘ π g = ρ g ∘ T` are equations of continuous linear maps exactly when
their underlying linear maps agree.

The left-hand side is the simp-normal form of `T ∈ (linHom π ρ).invariants`, which
`ContRepresentation.mem_invariants` and `ContRepresentation.linHom_apply` — both `simp` lemmas —
reduce to it; stating the lemma this way, exactly as Mathlib states its algebraic original, is what
makes it usable by `simp`. `ContRepresentation.mem_linHom_invariants_iff_isIntertwining` is the

# Products of representations

Mathlib forms the direct sum `Representation.directSum` and the binary product
`Representation.prod` of representations, but not the product of an arbitrary family. This file
defines it: for representations `ρ i` of a monoid `G` on modules `V i`, the representation
`Representation.pi ρ` acts on `∀ i, V i` factor by factor. The index type is arbitrary. Infinite
products are the case of interest, as in the unit part `∏_v ∏_{w ∣ v} 𝒪_wˣ` of the `S`-ideles of
a Galois extension of number fields, which is a product of representations of the Galois group
indexed by the places `v` outside `S`.

The invariants, the norm and, for a finite monoid, the coinvariant kernel of the product are
computed factor by factor. The last of these uses the finiteness of `G`: an element of the
coinvariant kernel is a sum `∑ g, (ρ g (y g) - y g)` with one term for each `g`, and such sums can
be chosen in every factor at once.

## Main definitions

* `Representation.pi ρ`: the product of a family of representations.
* `Rep.pi M`: the product of a family of objects of `Rep k G`.
* `Rep.piLift f`: the morphism into `Rep.pi M` with prescribed components `f i : A ⟶ M i`.

## Main results

* `Representation.mem_invariants_pi_iff`: an element of the product is invariant exactly when
  every component is.
* `Representation.norm_pi_apply`: the norm of the product acts factor by factor.
* `Representation.mem_ker_norm_pi_iff`: an element of the product has norm zero exactly when
  every component does.
* `Representation.mem_coinvariantsKer_pi_iff`: for a finite monoid, an element of the product lies
  in the coinvariant kernel exactly when every component does.

# The trivial F₂ coefficient representation

This file defines a trivial object of `TopRep ℤ G` whose carrier is a universe lift of `ZMod 2`.
It is stable under restriction and is smooth discrete, as needed for continuous cohomology with
trivial `𝔽₂` coefficients.

The homomorphism and isomorphism maps follow the `cohomFpMap` and `cohomFpLinearEquiv`
construction in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/TrivialFp.lean`,
with `ℤ` as the scalar ring used by the all-degree cup product.

For `G : Type u`, Mathlib's continuous-cohomology resolution requires the coefficient module to
live in `Type u`. The carrier of `trivialF2 G` is therefore `ULift.{u} (ZMod 2)`, not
`ZMod 2`. The action is trivial, and restriction to a subgroup is definitionally the corresponding
trivial coefficient object for that subgroup.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.trivialF2`: trivial `𝔽₂` coefficients over an arbitrary
  universe.
* `TauCeti.DiscreteRep.trivialF2`: the same coefficient object in the equivalent category of
  discrete continuous representations.
* `TauCeti.cohomF2`: continuous cohomology with trivial `𝔽₂` coefficients, with its canonical
  `ZMod 2`-module structure `TauCeti.cohomF2.instModule`.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2ResMap`: restriction on continuous cohomology with trivial `𝔽₂`
  coefficients.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2CoeffHom`: the identification of the trivial `𝔽₂` coefficients of two
  monoids, with `TauCeti.trivialF2CoeffHom_smul` its equivariance along a monoid
  homomorphism.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2Map`: pullback along any continuous group homomorphism with trivial
  `𝔽₂` coefficients, and `TauCeti.trivialF2Iso` for a topological group isomorphism.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2QuotientEquivFixedPoints`: trivial `𝔽₂` coefficients on a quotient `G ⧸ N`,
  identified with the `N`-fixed points of the ambient trivial `𝔽₂` coefficients.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.trivialF2_V`: the carrier is `ULift (ZMod 2)`.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2Equiv`: the additive equivalence that crosses the universe lift, with
  `TauCeti.trivialF2Equiv_cast` its invariance under casts between the carriers of two groups.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2_ρ_apply_apply`: every monoid element acts trivially.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2_two_nsmul_eq_zero`, `TauCeti.cohomF2.two_nsmul_eq_zero`: the coefficients,
  and hence every cohomology class, are killed by `2`.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2Pairing`: multiplication in `𝔽₂` as a biadditive pairing on the lifted
  carrier, with `TauCeti.trivialF2Pairing_smul_smul` its equivariance.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule_trivialF2`: the coefficient dictionary recovers `trivialF2`, with
  `TauCeti.eqToHom_ofDiscreteModule_trivialF2_apply` and
  `TauCeti.eqToHom_ofDiscreteModule_trivialF2_symm_apply` its carrier-level reading.
* `TauCeti.res_trivialF2`: restriction preserves the coefficient object on the nose.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2Map_subgroupSubtype`: the general pullback recovers subgroup restriction.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2Map_id`, `TauCeti.trivialF2Map_comp`: the functoriality laws.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2Map_eq_of_conj`: over a locally compact target, pullbacks along two
  homomorphisms that differ by an inner automorphism agree.
* `TauCeti.eqToHom_comp_trivialF2Map`: read in discrete models of the coefficients, the pullback
  is the compatible-pair map of any coefficient map that is the identity of `𝔽₂`.
* `TauCeti.isSmoothDiscrete_trivialF2`: the coefficient object is smooth discrete.
* `TauCeti.trivialF2QuotientEquivFixedPoints_smul`: that identification is equivariant for the
  `G ⧸ N`-actions, with `TauCeti.trivialF2Equiv_apply_trivialF2QuotientEquivFixedPoints` its
  value rule.

# Conway mutation of knots

Let `K` be a knot in a three-manifold and `B` a smoothly embedded closed three-ball whose boundary
sphere meets `K` in four points, through which `K` crosses from the inside of `B` to its outside.
Such a sphere is a *Conway sphere* for `K`. A *Conway mutant* of `K` is obtained by cutting out the
two-string tangle `K ∩ B` and gluing it back after one of the three half-turns of `B` that preserve
the four boundary points. Its orientation is fixed by local agreement with `K` on an outside arc.

The construction is stated on the geometric presentation of a knot, a smooth circle embedding
`K : S¹ → M` (`TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding`), with the ball given by a smooth embedding
`e : ℝ³ → M` as the image `e (D³)` of the closed unit ball. A choice of `e`, after an isotopy of
`K` supported near the sphere, brings every Conway sphere into the following standard position:

* the four points are `TauCeti.conwayPoints`, the points `(±1/√2, ±1/√2, 0)` of the unit sphere;
* the half-turns are `TauCeti.conwayHalfTurn i`, the rotations by `π` about the three coordinate
  axes, each of which permutes the four points without fixed points;
* near the sphere the knot is invariant under the chosen half-turn. Then rotating the tangle inside
  `B` leaves the knot unchanged near `∂B`, so the mutated set is again a smooth curve there.

The mutated set (`TauCeti.conwayMutation`) is `(K \ B) ∪ ρ(K ∩ B)`, read through `e`. Being a
mutant (`TauCeti.IsConwayMutant K K'`) is a relation between parametrized knots, rather than an
operation, because the mutated set must be reparametrized as a circle: `K'` is a mutant of `K` when
its image is the mutated set of `K` along some Conway sphere and half-turn, and when it agrees with
`K` near some point outside the ball up to an orientation-preserving change of parameter. For a
knot, this local agreement fixes the orientation of the mutant; the definition imposes agreement
only near the chosen point on its outside arc.

Mutation is symmetric (`TauCeti.IsConwayMutant.symm`): rotating the mutated tangle back recovers
`K` along the same Conway sphere. It is compatible with ambient diffeomorphisms, and a knot whose
tangle is itself invariant under the half-turn is a mutant of itself. The unknot in `S³` has Conway
spheres in standard position for all three half-turns, so the definitions apply to actual knots.

Mutants share many invariants: they have the same Alexander, Jones and HOMFLY polynomials. They need
not be concordant, however. Kirk and Livingston found infinite families of knots that are not even
topologically concordant to their positive mutants, answering Kirby's problem 1.53.
`TauCeti.KirkLivingstonMutationTheorem` records the resulting statement in the smooth category: some
knot in `S³` is not smoothly concordant to some Conway mutant. It is stated, not proved.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.conwayHalfTurn i`: the half-turn of `ℝ³` about the `i`-th coordinate axis.
* `TauCeti.conwayPoints`: the four points `(±1/√2, ±1/√2, 0)` of the unit sphere of `ℝ³`.
* `TauCeti.IsConwaySphere K e i`: the ball `e (D³)` meets `K` in a Conway sphere in standard
  position for the half-turn `i`.
* `TauCeti.conwayMutation e i S`: the set obtained from `S ⊆ M` by rotating its part inside the
  ball `e (D³)` by the half-turn `i`.
* `TauCeti.IsConwayMutant K K'`: `K'` is a Conway mutant of `K`.
* `TauCeti.KirkLivingstonMutationTheorem`: some knot in `S³` is not smoothly concordant to one of
  its Conway mutants.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.conwayMutation_conwayMutation`: mutating twice along the same ball and half-turn is the
  identity.
* `TauCeti.IsConwaySphere.of_range_eq_conwayMutation`: the Conway sphere of `K` is a Conway sphere
  of every mutant along it.
* `TauCeti.IsConwayMutant.symm`: mutation is a symmetric relation.
* `TauCeti.IsConwayMutant.transDiffeomorph`: mutation is preserved by ambient diffeomorphisms.
* `TauCeti.exists_isConwaySphere_unknot`: the unknot in `S³` has a Conway sphere in standard
  position for each half-turn; in a suitable ball chart it is an ellipse crossing the unit sphere
  at the four Conway points.

are topologically concordant. This answers Kirby's problem 1.53. It is recorded as a proposition
and not proved. -/

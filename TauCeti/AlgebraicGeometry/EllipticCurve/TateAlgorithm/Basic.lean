# Tate's algorithm: the singular point at the origin

Tate's algorithm reads the reduction type of a minimal Weierstrass equation over a discrete
valuation ring `R`, with uniformiser `π` and perfect residue field `k`, off a sequence of changes of
variables defined over `R` and divisibility tests on the coefficients. This file contains its first
two steps, from whose normal form every later step starts.

Step 1 tests whether `π ∣ Δ`: the reduction is good exactly when it does not
(`WeierstrassCurve.reduction_Δ_eq_zero_iff`). Otherwise the reduced curve is singular, and its
singular point is `k`-rational because `k` is perfect
(`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_isSingular_of_Δ_eq_zero`). Step 2 lifts that point to `R` and
translates it to the origin by `x ↦ x + r`, `y ↦ y + t`. Afterwards `π` divides `a₃`, `a₄` and
`a₆`, so the reduced equation reads `y² + a₁ x y = x³ + a₂ x²` and has `c₄ = b₂²`. On such an
equation:

* the reduction is multiplicative exactly when `π ∤ b₂`, and additive exactly when `π ∣ b₂`;
* a multiplicative reduction is split exactly when the tangent quadratic `T² + a₁ T − a₂` splits
  over `k`, its roots being the slopes of the two tangent lines at the node.

Every reduction type is invariant under changes of variables defined over `R`
(`WeierstrassCurve.hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_smul_iff` and its companions), so these
tests decide the reduction type of the equation one started from.

Perfectness of `k` is used only to find the singular point. Over the imperfect field `𝔽₃(s)` the
cubic `y² = x³ − s` is singular only at `(s^{1/3}, 0)`, which is not rational.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.map_residue_isSingular_zero_iff`: the reduction of an integral equation over a
  local ring is singular at the origin exactly when `a₆`, `a₄` and `a₃` lie in the maximal ideal.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_map_residue_variableChange_isSingular_zero`: over a local ring with
  perfect residue field, an integral equation whose discriminant lies in the maximal ideal is
  translated over `R` to one whose reduction is singular at the origin.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_reduction_baseChange_smul_isSingular_zero`: a minimal equation with bad
  reduction is translated over `R` to a minimal equation whose reduction is singular at the
  origin.
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasMultiplicativeReduction_iff_reduction_b₂_ne_zero` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.hasAdditiveReduction_iff_reduction_b₂_eq_zero`: on a minimal equation whose
  reduction is singular at the origin, the reduction is multiplicative when `π ∤ b₂` and additive
  when `π ∣ b₂`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction_iff_reduction_b₂_ne_zero_and_splits`: on such
  an equation, the reduction is split multiplicative exactly when `π ∤ b₂` and `T² + a₁ T − a₂`
  splits over the residue field.

* `WeierstrassCurve.dvd_b₄_and_dvd_b₆_and_sq_dvd_b₈_of_dvd_b₂_of_dvd_a₃_of_dvd_a₄_of_dvd_a₆`
  and `WeierstrassCurve.sq_dvd_Δ_of_dvd_b₂_of_dvd_a₃_of_dvd_a₄_of_dvd_a₆`: the invariant and
  discriminant divisibilities of the additive Step 2 normal form.

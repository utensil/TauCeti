# Reduction of points at good reduction

Let `v` be a valuation on a field `F`, with valuation ring `O` and residue field `k`, and let `W` be
a Weierstrass curve over `F` with an integral model `W_O` over `O` whose discriminant is a unit of
`O`, so that `W` has good reduction and the reduced curve `W_k = W_O ⊗ k` is an elliptic curve. This
file shows that reduction of points (`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.reduction`) is then a group
homomorphism `W(F) →+ W_k(k)`: Silverman VII.2.1 in the case of good reduction, where the subgroup
`E₀(F)` of points with nonsingular reduction (`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonsingularReduction`) is all
of `W(F)`. Its kernel is the kernel of reduction `E₁(F)`, the points whose `x`-coordinate has a
pole, and it is surjective when `O` is Henselian.

Since the reduced curve is elliptic, every point of it is nonsingular, so every point of `W(F)` has
nonsingular reduction. The reduction homomorphism is then the homomorphism
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonsingularReductionHom` on `E₀(F) = W(F)`.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.reductionHom`: at good reduction, the reduction homomorphism
  `W(F) →+ W_k(k)`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.nonsingularLift_reduction`: at good reduction, every point reduces
  to a nonsingular point of the reduced curve.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonsingularReduction_eq_top`: at good reduction, every point has
  nonsingular reduction.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.reduction_add`: at good reduction, reduction commutes with
  addition.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.reductionHom_eq_zero_iff`: the kernel of the reduction
  homomorphism consists of the point at infinity and the points whose `x`-coordinate has a pole.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.reductionHom_surjective`: if the valuation ring is Henselian, the
  reduction homomorphism is surjective.

# Points with nonsingular reduction

Let `v` be a valuation on a field `F`, with valuation ring `O` and residue field `k`, and let `W`
be a Weierstrass curve over `F` with an integral model `W_O` over `O`. Every point of `W(F)` reduces
to a `k`-point of the reduced curve `W_k = W_O ⊗ k` (`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.reduction`).
When `W_k` is singular, the reduction of a point may be its singular point. This file defines the
subgroup

`E₀(F) = {P ∈ W(F) | the reduction of P is a nonsingular point of W_k}`

and shows that reduction is a group homomorphism `E₀(F) →+ W_k,ns(k)` to the group of nonsingular
points of `W_k`, whose kernel is the kernel of reduction `E₁(F)`: the point at infinity together
with the points whose `x`-coordinate has a pole. This is the left-exact part of Silverman's exact
sequence `0 → E₁(F) → E₀(F) → W_k,ns(k) → 0` (AEC VII.2.1), for an arbitrary valuation and an
arbitrary integral model. The hypotheses are those of the statement: neither ellipticity of `W`,
minimality of `W_O`, discreteness of `v` nor completeness of `F` is assumed.

The sequence is also right-exact when `O` is Henselian, for instance complete: the reduction
homomorphism is then surjective. This is Hensel's lemma applied to the Weierstrass equation in
whichever variable has a nonvanishing partial derivative at the point of `W_k`
(`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_nonsingular_residue_eq`).

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonsingularReduction`: the subgroup `E₀(F)` of points whose
  reduction is a nonsingular point of the reduced curve.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonsingularReductionHom`: the reduction homomorphism
  `E₀(F) →+ W_k,ns(k)`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.reduction_add_of_nonsingularLift`: if `P` and `Q` reduce to
  nonsingular points, then the reduction of `P + Q` is the sum of their reductions.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.some_mem_nonsingularReduction_iff`: an affine point with integral
  coordinates lies in `E₀(F)` exactly when the residues of its coordinates form a nonsingular point
  of the reduced curve.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.mem_nonsingularReduction_of_one_lt`: the kernel of reduction is
  contained in `E₀(F)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonsingularReductionHom_eq_zero_iff`: the kernel of the reduction
  homomorphism is the kernel of reduction `E₁(F)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.mem_ker_nonsingularReductionHom_iff`: the same statement for the kernel
  subgroup `E₁(F)` of `E₀(F)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonsingularReductionHom_surjective`: if the valuation ring is
  Henselian, the reduction homomorphism is surjective.

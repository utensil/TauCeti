# The `n`-torsion of an elliptic curve over a scheme

Let `E` be an elliptic curve over a scheme `S`, with its group law (`EllipticCurveGeom.grpObj`),
and let `n` be an integer. The `n`-torsion `E[n]` of `E` is the scheme-theoretic kernel of
multiplication by `n`, `[n] : E ⟶ E` (`EllipticCurveGeom.mulBy`): the kernel of the homomorphism
`Grp.ofHom (E.mulBy n)` of group schemes over `S`, constructed in `TauCeti.GroupScheme`. It is a
group scheme over `S`, with a homomorphism `E[n] ⟶ E` of group schemes over `S`
(`EllipticCurveGeom.torsionι`).

On underlying schemes, `E[n]` is the fibre of `[n]` over the zero section, so its inclusion into `E`
is a closed immersion. Its points with values in any `Z` over `S` are the points of `E` with values
in `Z` killed by `[n]`, as a group. Its formation commutes with arbitrary base change: a pointed
morphism of elliptic curves `E' ⟶ E` forming a pullback square over a morphism of bases
`S' ⟶ S` induces a morphism `E'[n] ⟶ E[n]` forming a pullback square over `S' ⟶ S`.

Nothing here asserts that `E[n]` is finite or flat over `S`: for `n ≠ 0` it is finite locally
free of rank `n²`, which rests on the finiteness and flatness of `[n]`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.torsion E n`: the `n`-torsion `E[n]`, a group
  object of `Over S`.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.torsionι E n`: its inclusion `E[n] ⟶ E`, a
  homomorphism of group schemes over `S`.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.torsionLift`: the point of `E[n]` given by a point
  of `E` killed by `[n]`.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.torsionPointsMulEquiv`: the points of `E[n]` with
  values in `Z` are the kernel of `[n]` on the points of `E` with values in `Z`.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.torsionMap`: the morphism `E'[n] ⟶ E[n]` induced
  by a base change square of elliptic curves.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.torsion_eq_kernel`: `E[n]` is the kernel of the
  integer `n` of the endomorphism ring of `E`.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.isPullback_torsion`: `E[n]` is the fibre of `[n]`
  over the zero section.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.isCommMonObj_torsion`: `E[n]` is a commutative group
  scheme over `S`.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.isClosedImmersion_torsionι_left`: `E[n] ⟶ E` is a
  closed immersion; consequently `E[n]` is proper over `S`
  (`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.isProper_torsion_hom`).
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.isPullback_torsionMap`: the `n`-torsion commutes
  with base change.

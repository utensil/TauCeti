# The triangulation conjecture

The **triangulation conjecture** in dimension `n` asserts that every closed topological
`n`-manifold is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of an abstract simplicial complex.
Here a closed topological `n`-manifold is a compact Hausdorff space carrying charts to
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`; no smooth, PL, or other compatibility of the transition maps is
imposed. Second countability is not assumed separately, since a compact space locally
homeomorphic to Euclidean space is second countable
(`ChartedSpace.secondCountable_of_sigmaCompact`). The Hausdorff hypothesis is essential: a
realization is Hausdorff, so without it a compact non-Hausdorff locally Euclidean space would
refute the conjecture for a trivial reason.

The conclusion uses the general predicate `TauCeti.IsTriangulable`, which imposes no link
condition on the triangulating complex. This is the form relevant to Manolescu's theorem:
for every `n ≥ 5` there is a closed topological `n`-manifold admitting no triangulation at all,
that is `∀ n, 5 ≤ n → ¬ TauCeti.TriangulationConjecture n`. The older Kirby–Siebenmann result
instead gives the weaker conclusion that some manifolds admit no combinatorial triangulation;
combinatorial triangulability (`TauCeti.IsCombinatoriallyTriangulable`) is itself the stronger
notion because it imposes an additional link condition.

The conjecture is stated, not proved. It holds in dimension zero, where every such space is
discrete (`TauCeti.triangulationConjecture_zero`); it is also known in dimensions at most three
(Radó, Moise), fails in dimension four by the work of Freedman and Casson, and fails in every
dimension at least five by Manolescu.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.TriangulationConjecture`: every closed topological `n`-manifold is triangulable.
* `TauCeti.ManolescuTheorem`: the non-triangulation statement in every dimension at least five.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.not_triangulationConjecture_iff`: a disproof is a closed topological manifold that is
  not triangulable, the shape of Manolescu's theorem.
* `TauCeti.manolescuTheorem_iff`: the theorem is equivalent to the existence of a
  non-triangulable closed topological manifold in each dimension at least five.
* `TauCeti.isTriangulable_of_chartedSpace_zero`: every space locally homeomorphic to `ℝ⁰` is
  triangulable.
* `TauCeti.triangulationConjecture_zero`: the conjecture holds in dimension zero.

/-- The **triangulation conjecture** in dimension `n`: every compact Hausdorff space locally
homeomorphic to `ℝⁿ` (a closed topological `n`-manifold) is homeomorphic to the geometric
realization of an abstract simplicial complex.

Manolescu proved that this fails for every `n ≥ 5`. -/

/-- Manolescu's non-triangulation theorem, recorded as its mathematical statement.

For every dimension at least five, some closed topological manifold is not homeomorphic to the
realization of any abstract simplicial complex. This declaration records the theorem's statement

# Binary quadratic forms over a local field

Over a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic different from two, a binary regular
quadratic form is determined by its discriminant and local Hasse invariant. Its nonzero
represented values are determined by the same invariants: `⟨a, b⟩` represents a unit `c`
exactly when `(c, -ab) = (a, b)`. This describes both the hyperbolic case, which represents
every unit, and the anisotropic case, whose values form a coset of the quadratic norm group.

The representation criterion is stated for arbitrary regular binary spaces, so a caller need
not choose a diagonalization. These are the binary inputs to classification by splitting off
a represented line and cancelling.

# The fixed field of a subgroup meeting the cyclotomic fixers trivially

If `M` contains a primitive `m`-th root of unity and a subgroup `H ≤ Gal(M/K)` meets
`Gal(M/K(μ_m))` trivially, then `M` is an `m`-th cyclotomic extension of the fixed field `M ^ H`.

Only the subgroup `H` is assumed finite; `M / K` need not be finite or Galois. The root of unity
enters as a hypothesis rather than through an ambient cyclotomic tower, so no separately quantified
intermediate field or cyclotomic tower appears among the arguments — the fixed field itself is of
course an `IntermediateField K M`,
being the base of the conclusion.

Nothing here needs `H` to be cyclic. The Chebotarev application takes `H = Subgroup.zpowers (σ, τ)`,
but the argument is the Galois correspondence and uses neither a generator nor cyclicity.

## Main results

* `IsPrimitiveRoot.fixedField_isCyclotomicExtension_of_inf_fixingSubgroup_eq_bot`

## Provenance

The proof is adapted from the private `compositum_isCyclotomic_over_fixedField` in
`CebotarevDensity/Abelian.lean` of
[CBirkbeck/chebotarev-density](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/chebotarev-density) (Apache-2.0,
Birkbeck--Brasca) at commit `8575c9df1ae0a61120ab5c964c7911414254bec7`. That version is stated for
a cyclic subgroup over a tower `K ⊆ L ⊆ M` of number fields; the hypotheses here are weaker.

/-- **The fixed field of `H` carries the cyclotomic extension**, whenever `H` meets the fixers of
`K(μ_m)` trivially.

The trivial meet says exactly that `M ^ H` and `K(μ_m)` generate `M`, so adjoining a primitive
root to `M ^ H` recovers all of `M`. -/

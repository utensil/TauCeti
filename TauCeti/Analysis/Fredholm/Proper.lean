# A map with upper semi-Fredholm derivative is proper near the point

A continuous map between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces need not be proper: a Fredholm linear
map with nonzero kernel has a noncompact fibre over zero. A map whose derivative at a point `a` is
closed-range with finite-dimensional complemented kernel — in particular, a **Fredholm**
operator — is nonetheless proper on a neighbourhood of `a`:

`∃ N ∈ 𝓝 a, ∀ L compact, N ∩ f ⁻¹' L is compact`.

This is Smale's local properness lemma, the geometric half of the input to the Sard--Smale theorem
(Smale, *An infinite dimensional version of Sard's theorem*, Amer. J. Math. 87 (1965), 861–866;
McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix A). Its consequence
recorded here is that the preimage `f ⁻¹' L` of a compact set — in particular a level set
`f ⁻¹' {c}`, as occurs for moduli spaces defined by Fredholm equations — is a
**locally compact** space, even when its ambient Banach space is not locally compact.

The proof is quantitative rather than chart-theoretic. The a priori estimate
`ContinuousLinearMap.exists_projection_norm_le` supplies a continuous projection `P`
of `E` onto `ker f'` and a constant `C > 0` with `‖x‖ ≤ C * ‖f' x‖ + ‖P x‖`. On a small enough
closed ball `N` around `a`, strict differentiability turns this into the two-sided bound

`‖x - y‖ ≤ 2 * (C * ‖f x - f y‖) + 2 * ‖P x - P y‖`  for `x, y ∈ N`,

so the map `x ↦ (f x, P x)` is anti-Lipschitz on `N`. Its second component takes values in the
finite-dimensional space `ker f'`, where bounded sets have compact closure, so `x ↦ (f x, P x)`
sends `N ∩ f ⁻¹' L` into a compact box; being anti-Lipschitz, it reflects total boundedness, and
`N ∩ f ⁻¹' L` is totally bounded and closed, hence compact.

## Main declarations

* `HasStrictFDerivAt.exists_mem_nhds_forall_isCompact_inter_preimage`: local properness.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.exists_mem_nhds_isCompact_inter_preimage_singleton`: an arbitrary fibre is
  compact near the point of differentiation.
* `TauCeti.locallyCompactSpace_preimage` and `TauCeti.locallyCompactSpace_preimage_singleton`: the
  preimage of a compact set, and in particular a level set, along which the derivative is Fredholm
  is locally compact.

At a regular point, the zero set of a Fredholm map is a manifold of dimension its index;
`TauCeti.Analysis.Fredholm.LevelSet.Basic` supplies those charts. Local properness complements
this description at singular points and makes the critical values of a Fredholm map locally
closed in the Sard--Smale argument.

/-- **Local properness of a map with upper semi-Fredholm derivative.** If `f` is strictly
differentiable at `a` and its derivative there has closed range and finite-dimensional
complemented kernel, then `f` is proper on a neighbourhood `N` of `a`: the part of the preimage of
any compact set lying in `N` is compact.

Compare `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_projection_norm_le`, the linear estimate this is read off
from: the kernel direction, in which `f'` loses all control, is finite-dimensional, so the loss of
compactness it causes is harmless. -/

/-- **The preimage of a compact set under a map with upper semi-Fredholm derivative is locally
compact.** If `f` is strictly differentiable at each point of `f ⁻¹' L`, its derivative there has
closed range and finite-dimensional complemented kernel, and `L` is compact, then `f ⁻¹' L`, with
the topology induced from `E`, is a locally compact space.

No compactness is assumed of the ambient Banach space, and none is available: the point is that
the hypotheses confine the failure of local compactness to the finite-dimensional kernel
direction, which is itself locally compact and is controlled by the kernel projection. -/

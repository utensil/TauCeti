# The heat semigroup on `Lᵖ`

On a finite-dimensional real inner product space `E` of dimension `n`, convolution with the heat
kernel `K_t(x) = (4πt)^(-n/2) exp(-‖x‖² / (4t))` defines, for `1 ≤ p < ∞`, the **heat
semigroup** `e^{tΔ}` on `Lᵖ(E; F)` with values in a real Banach space `F`:

`e^{tΔ} f = K_t ⋆ f = ∫ y, K_t(y) • f(· - y) dy` for `t > 0`, and `e^{0Δ} f = f`.

This file proves that it is a **strongly continuous contraction semigroup**:

* each `e^{tΔ}` is a contraction of `Lᵖ`, by Young's inequality, because `K_t ≥ 0` has mass one;
* `e^{(s+t)Δ} = e^{sΔ} e^{tΔ}`, from the Chapman–Kolmogorov identity `K_s ⋆ K_t = K_{s+t}` and
  associativity of convolution on `Lᵖ`;
* `e^{tΔ} f → f` in `Lᵖ` as `t → 0⁺`: the heat kernel is an approximate identity, applied to the
  continuous bounded `Lᵖ`-valued orbit `y ↦ f(· + y)` of translations.

For `t > 0` the class `e^{tΔ} f` is represented almost everywhere by the classical convolution
`K_t ⋆ f`; for essentially bounded `f`, `TauCeti.hasDerivAt_heatKernel_convolution` shows that
this convolution is smooth and solves the heat equation pointwise. The generator of the
semigroup, the Laplacian on `Lᵖ` with its natural domain, is not identified in this file.

The restriction `p < ∞` is essential: on `L^∞` the operators are still contractions, but the
semigroup is not strongly continuous at `0`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.tendsto_convolutionLp_heatKernel`: `K_t ⋆ f → f` in `Lᵖ` as `t → 0⁺`.
* `TauCeti.heatSemigroup`: the heat semigroup on `Lᵖ`, as a `ContractionSemigroup`.
* `TauCeti.heatSemigroup_apply`, `TauCeti.heatSemigroup_apply_apply`: for `t ≠ 0`, the operator
  at time `t` is convolution with `K_t`.
* `TauCeti.heatSemigroup_zero`: the operator at time `0` is the identity.
* `TauCeti.heatSemigroup_ae_eq_convolution`: for `t ≠ 0`, `e^{tΔ} f` is represented almost
  everywhere by the classical convolution `K_t ⋆ f`.
